# Sass

To be able to use `.sass` or `.scss` files in your project, follow [the official Sass support guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support).

1. Add `sass` package as a dev dependency
2. Optionaly configure Sass with `sassOptions` in `next.config.js`

It's a pretty simple and straightforward matter but if you'd like to read more about it, there is one of [How to use sass with css modules in Next.js](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-sass-with-css-modules-in-next-js/) articles
